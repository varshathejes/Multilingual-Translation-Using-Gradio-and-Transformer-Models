# Multilingual-Translation-Using-Gradio-and-Transformer-Models

 a Gradio interface where users can input a YouTube video URL to fetch auto-generated captions and then translate those captions into various languages.

This project effectively demonstrates the practical application of machine learning, specifically
transformer models, for multilingual translation tasks. By leveraging Gradio for interface development
and Hugging Face's pre-trained models for translation, the project delivers a user-friendly and efficient
solution for translating video captions across languages.
